# Changelog

## 0.8.3 - 2026-09-24

- Refined the Token dashboard into a responsive chroma-bento layout with smooth model trends, period-aware hourly heatmaps, model consumption share, larger tutorial QR presentation, and resilient account-pool sizing.
- Added fully local account-masked PNG generation: desktop browsers download the result directly, while mobile browsers receive a long-press save preview without invoking system sharing or a server-side screenshot process.
- Preserved the live page's responsive geometry during export, embedded local image assets, retained a compatibility renderer, and fixed html2canvas foreign-object coordinate drift that cropped the left and top edges.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-09-21

- Switched dashboard quota snapshots to Antigravity's official `/usage` summary, showing the shared weekly and five-hour limits for the Gemini and Claude/GPT model groups per account.
- Kept model-catalog quota observations for routing compatibility while model usage charts continue to reflect the exact model IDs actually called.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-09-21

- Made the managed account pool the dashboard's only account source, so historical or unbound usage identifiers can no longer appear as accounts or affect account/model aggregates.
- Replaced the single highest-model quota display with per-account details for every model actually called, including exact usage, model-specific remaining quota, reset time, and stale-snapshot state.
- Kept the most recent expired quota snapshot visible as an explicitly marked previous snapshot while routing continues to use only fresh quota observations.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-09-20

- Added a lightweight dark Token dashboard at `/dashboard`, opened with `antigravity-gateway stats` while either foreground or background mode is active and served by the existing gateway process without another web service.
- Added 1/3/7/30-day and account filters with lifetime KPIs, account quota cards, hourly heatmaps, model trends, and daily Token composition.
- Extended the persistent aggregate model with hourly account, model, and account-model dimensions while remaining backward compatible with existing usage files and continuing to store no prompts or responses.
- Added dashboard endpoint, data-shape, persistence-dimension, self-contained asset, and regression coverage.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-19

- Added persistent multi-account OAuth login from the running foreground gateway: type `add` at `gateway>`, with both automatic browser opening and the complete copyable authorization URL.
- Complete first-login authorization through the official Antigravity OAuth client, `loadCodeAssist` tier discovery, asynchronous `onboardUser` project initialization, and post-onboarding project re-discovery before persisting an account; pasted localhost callback URLs are accepted while authorization is active and receive a clear stale-flow message afterward.
- Added plain per-account JSON persistence under `~/.antigravity-gateway/accounts/`. Managed access/refresh tokens survive gateway restarts and refreshed values are written back atomically; no encryption, ACL, or custom file-permission layer is imposed.
- Added sticky client-session routing, smooth weighted account rotation, one-attempt-per-account failover, model-specific quota cooldowns, authentication cooldowns, and request-error classification while preserving every client model ID unchanged.
- Added asynchronous per-account, per-model quota snapshots from the real model catalog and low-overhead exact usage accounting from upstream metadata, separating client requests from upstream attempts and tracking input, output, thinking, cached, and total tokens.
- Persist usage only when dirty every five minutes, refresh the 24-hour histogram hourly, and refresh the historical dashboard total every 24 hours.
- Added the foreground terminal console with `add`, `acc`, `models`, `status`, `usage`, `reload`, `config`, `logs`, `clear`, `version`, `help`, and `quit` commands. Background service behavior and existing client endpoints remain unchanged.
- The gateway now imports a newly detected official local agy account into the managed pool on startup without overwriting an existing matching account, and request routing logs identify the account actually selected for each upstream attempt.
- Added regression tests for account persistence, sticky rotation, quota failover, request-error handling, usage persistence, hourly buckets, OAuth callback parsing, and terminal charts.

## 0.6.2 - 2026-09-18

- Fixed Claude Code 2.1.276 requests being rejected by Cloud Code as `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` because Claude Code copied an `x-anthropic-billing-header` transport marker into the model-visible system text.
- Strip only that Anthropic-specific billing pseudo-header before native Cloud Code forwarding; the complete conversation, tool schemas, system instructions, output budget, and Gemini context window remain unchanged.
- Added regression coverage that preserves adjacent system instructions while removing the rejected transport metadata.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-09-07

- Reject invalid Host headers safely and deny unapproved browser origins while preserving origin-free CLI access.
- Enforce request deadlines and bound uploads before body parsing; reject ambiguous Auto Mode XML instead of choosing an allow verdict.
- Validate nested JSON Schema combinators and tuples; preserve model IDs, full input, and client-side tool execution.
- Refresh model catalogs with concurrent probe deduplication and stale-catalog fallback; coalesce local OAuth refreshes and honor custom agy paths.
- Rotate background logs during execution, bound log-tail reads, restart existing Linux services after configuration updates, and use USERPROFILE on Windows when HOME is absent.
- Refuse to persist explicit OAuth token/client-secret environment variables in background snapshots; foreground usage and local agy login remain unchanged.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-04

- Replaced the top-level-only tool-schema cleanup with a recursive compatibility normalizer for `properties`, `items`, `prefixItems`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, and `allOf`, fixing Claude Code 2.1.259/2.1.260 `Artifact` tool requests rejected by Cloud Code for missing nested array `items`.
- Removed the local model catalog as a request gate. Normal client requests now preserve the exact model ID and always reach Antigravity upstream, even when discovery does not list that model.
- Preserve upstream failures and append a non-blocking gateway diagnosis only when the requested model is absent from the currently discovered catalog. Auto Mode retains its separate fast-model route.
- Raised the default direct model-catalog discovery timeout from three to eight seconds after real macOS requests were observed completing in about five seconds; the environment override remains available.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-03

- Added `antigravity-gateway service start` as the cross-platform background keepalive entry point while preserving the existing foreground `antigravity-gateway` command.
- Added service lifecycle commands for status, restart, stop, logs, and uninstall. Re-running `service start` refreshes the saved gateway environment and restarts the existing service without creating duplicates.
- Added native per-user integration with macOS LaunchAgents, Linux systemd user services with linger enablement, and Windows Task Scheduler using S4U plus startup/login triggers.
- Added a platform-independent supervisor that restarts a failed gateway process after three seconds, with operating-system supervision retained for supervisor failures.
- Added private environment snapshots, 10 MiB rotating service logs, install-time foreground/background command guidance, and automated service-definition coverage.
- Verified foreground compatibility and the complete background lifecycle on macOS ARM64, Debian Linux, and Windows 11 x64, including real direct requests and forced child-process recovery.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-03

- Added one deterministic, presentation-only model order for the startup banner, `--models`, `/v1/models`, and generated Claude Code/Codex catalogs. Models not named in the preferred list remain visible after it, while request routing and the client-selected model ID remain unchanged.
- Added native Linux local-session discovery through the official `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` file and Secret Service, while preserving macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager behavior.
- Preserved `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` in the isolated Linux agy child environment so Secret Service remains reachable without exposing unrelated credentials.
- Placed `gemini-3.8-flash-high` first in model presentation and grouped the remaining Gemini 3.8 Flash variants after `gemini-3.1-flash-image`; made 3.8 High the missing-model-field default and preferred 3.8 Low for Auto Mode classifiers.
- Recorded the verified Gemini 3.8 Flash 1,048,576-token input and 65,536-token output metadata as the catalog fallback.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-09-02

- Corrected the startup BaseURL label from `Antigravity` to `Anthropic`, matching the protocol served at the root URL. The OpenAI-compatible endpoint remains `/v1`.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-01

- Preserve the exact model ID supplied by Anthropic, Responses, and Chat Completions clients. The default model is now used only when a request omits `model`.
- Removed automatic Claude/GPT/Haiku alias rewriting. Unknown models are sent upstream unchanged; `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL_ALIASES` remains available only for user-defined exact mappings.
- Restrict the auxiliary fast-model route to detected Claude Code Auto Mode classifier requests, without changing the model used by the main conversation.
- Added a concise startup banner with protocol-specific BaseURLs, API-key guidance, the active local credential source, and selected Gemini 3.7/Claude model IDs.
- Added `--models`, `--claude-config`, and `--claude-config-path`. The generated Claude Code `modelPicker` settings expose every model discovered for the current account without inventing aliases.
- Kept the Windows/macOS local credential acquisition implementation unchanged.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-09-01

- Added Windows Credential Manager authentication lookup for `LegacyGeneric:target=gemini:antigravity`, with the existing local session files retained as fallbacks.
- Preserved macOS Keychain-first authentication and added platform-injected coverage so the Windows credential reader can be tested without affecting macOS.
- Verified the release on macOS and Windows 11 with agy 1.1.22, including token refresh, model discovery, and a real direct request.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-31

- Added first-class Windows support for the official `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity-cli\antigravity-oauth-token` session and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin\agy.exe`, without changing the existing macOS Keychain-first path.
- Preserved the Windows profile, system, temporary-directory, and executable lookup variables required by agy child processes while continuing to exclude unrelated credentials.
- Replaced whole-binary OAuth metadata reads with bounded incremental scanning so the Windows native agy executable can be inspected without allocating hundreds of megabytes as a string.
- Detect the real agy version in direct mode on both Windows and macOS and handle Claude Code's `GET`/`POST`/`HEAD /api/hello` connectivity probes.
- Acknowledge Claude Code's `/api/event_logging/batch` locally with HTTP 204 instead of forwarding telemetry or logging a false missing-interface error.
- Added current Claude Code 2.1.251 Auto Mode block/severity contract detection and raised only the upstream classifier reasoning budget so complete XML verdicts are returned without retry storms.
- Raised the Gemini 3 provider-side minimum for tiny output caps after real macOS testing proved that hidden reasoning could truncate a six-token answer; normal client context remains untouched.
- Added native OpenAI Responses `custom_tool_call` and `custom_tool_call_output` round trips, including Codex `apply_patch` grammar projection, instead of degrading free-form tools into incompatible function calls.
- Use Cloud Code's discovered `maxTokens` and `maxOutputTokens`; Gemini 3.7 Flash now advertises its verified 1,048,576-token input window and 65,536-token output limit rather than the old 200K fallback.
- Reclassified gateway body/prompt guards as byte limits, raised both defaults to 64 MiB, and removed misleading context-window wording. The gateway still leaves authoritative token accounting to Cloud Code.
- Generate a per-user Codex model catalog at startup and expose its path through the banner, health response, and `--codex-catalog-path`, preventing Codex fallback metadata warnings.
- Verified on Windows 11 x64 with agy 1.1.22, Claude Code 2.1.251, and Codex CLI 0.151.0: direct login reuse, 1M client configuration, PowerShell tools, Auto Mode, Explore subagents, Responses tools, and `apply_patch`. Regressed real Anthropic/Responses and Claude Code/Codex file tools on macOS ARM64.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-08-30

- Fixed Claude Code 2.1.251 requests being rejected by Cloud Code as `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` because of the newly injected standalone `You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.` provider marker. The gateway now replaces only that transport-specific identity line with a neutral compatibility identity and preserves the rest of the system prompt unchanged.
- Fixed Claude Code 2.1.251 built-in helper agents and Auto mode probes competing with the main session for the same high-capacity model route. Haiku aliases and detected Auto mode classifiers now select an available low-latency model by default.
- Added `ANTIGRAVITY_FAST_MODEL` for an explicit helper/classifier model override; exact entries in `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL_ALIASES` still take precedence.
- Fixed direct transport stopping immediately on a `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` response from `daily-cloudcode`; retryable 429/5xx responses now try the normal Cloud Code endpoint and use one bounded exponential-backoff retry.
- Added `fast_model` to health/model discovery responses and show both default and auxiliary routes in the startup banner.
- Treat Claude Code cancellation of superseded classifier/tool requests as normal control flow instead of reporting a misleading gateway internal error.
- Added regression coverage for Haiku routing, Auto mode routing, daily-to-normal 429 fallback, and bounded retry recovery.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-23

- Added the gateway version to the startup banner, health response, `--help`, and `--version`, all sourced from `package.json`.
- Fixed direct-mode authentication on macOS by reading the official `gemini / antigravity` Keychain record before stale local session files.
- Fixed OAuth client-secret discovery so adjacent Mach-O bytes are not included in the secret; expired access tokens can now be refreshed directly without handing model requests to agy.
- Made native Cloud Code `direct` transport the default; missing credentials now fail explicitly instead of silently switching to the agy Agent transport.
- Added native Cloud Code transport that reuses the local Keychain/session state in memory, so requests can skip the `agy` Agent wrapper prompt without a second OAuth setup.
- Kept explicit auth JSON/access-token/refresh-token/project configuration as a documented manual fallback; refreshed local tokens are never written back by the gateway.
- Added local agy auth discovery, in-memory refresh, native request envelopes, Antigravity User-Agent/tool mode, function-call projection, and upstream text-delta forwarding.
- Added direct `fetchAvailableModels` discovery with daily-to-production fallback and a bounded timeout; explicit `ANTIGRAVITY_DIRECT_MODELS` still overrides discovery.
- Added a small minimum output budget for high/thinking models so low client caps do not consume the entire turn on hidden reasoning and return an empty visible message.
- Added live text SSE forwarding for plain Anthropic and Chat Completions requests; constrained tool, Auto mode, and structured-output requests remain buffered for validation.
- Added direct-provider unit coverage and documented the new transport and credential boundaries in both README languages.
- Normalized nullable/union tool schema types to the scalar schema format accepted by Cloud Code.
- Fixed native tool-history requests by removing Claude-only tool IDs from Gemini function-call parts.
- Preserved Cloud Code `thoughtSignature` values across Claude tool turns so follow-up requests can use prior native function calls.
- Added Gemini 3 thought-signature replay compatibility for stale Claude histories: real signatures are preserved, while a missing signature uses the first-call `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel and is not duplicated across parallel calls.
- Replaced the direct transport's XML tool-call envelope with typed `functionCall`/`functionResponse` mapping, including tool IDs, tool-name correlation, streamed argument assembly, and native tool-call validation.
- Upstream HTTP 400 diagnostics now include the sanitized provider reason instead of only a generic gateway error.
- Removed maintainer-specific absolute paths and resolve `agy` from the current user's `PATH` by default.
- Moved transient workspaces and logs from the source tree to a per-user operating-system temporary directory, with an environment-variable override.
- Reworked the bilingual README for arbitrary installation directories, account-specific model discovery, and macOS/Linux/Windows environment configuration.
- Added a global CLI installation flow so users can install in one command and run `antigravity-gateway` from any directory.
- Added an npm lifecycle environment check for Node.js, supported operating systems/architectures, and writable temporary storage.
- Added fallback discovery for the official per-user `agy` install locations when the current shell has not reloaded its updated `PATH`.
- Documented Node.js/npm bootstrap commands for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Switched the GitHub install command to the branch tarball URL for reliable npm lifecycle execution without requiring a Git checkout.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-22

- Added official `agy` headless subprocess adapter with Keyring-session reuse.
- Added Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, and Chat Completions endpoints.
- Added OpenAI and Codex-compatible model catalogs.
- Added experimental client tool projection and result round trips.
- Added Claude Code Auto mode XML and JSON Schema normalization.
- Added process isolation, environment filtering, concurrency limits, cancellation, SSE heartbeats, and log cleanup.
- Verified real Gemini responses, Claude Code text/tool loops, and Codex CLI basic Responses usage.
